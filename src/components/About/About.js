        <h3>PASSIONATE FRONT-END DEVELOPER BASED IN TORONTO</h3>
        <p>
          I DISCOVERED MY LOVE FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT IN 2017 DURING AN INTERNSHIP
          AS A FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPER AT A START-UP. TO THIS DAY, I CONTINUE
          TO EXPLORE VARIOUS TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES WITH THE GOAL OF DELIVERING
          THE FINEST WEB EXPERIENCES.
        </p>
        <p>
          I AM CREATIVE AND GIVE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL.
          ALONG WITH THE SKILLS Iâ€™VE HONED OVER THE YEARS, THIS ALLOWS ME TO
          CRAFT WEBSITES THAT ARE BOTH FUNCTIONAL AND VISUALLY APPEALING WITH
          PROFICIENCY.
